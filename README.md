# CS-552: Modern Natural Language Processing

### Course Description
Natural language processing is ubiquitous in modern intelligent technologies, serving as a foundation for language translators, virtual assistants, search engines, and many more. In this course, we cover the foundations of modern methods for natural language processing, such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and pretraining, and how they can be applied to important tasks in the field, such as machine translation and text classification. We also cover issues with these state-of-the-art approaches (such as robustness, interpretability, sensitivity), identify their failure modes in different NLP applications, and discuss analysis and mitigation techniques for these issues.

All lectures will be given in person and live streamed on Zoom. The link to the Zoom is available on the Ed Forum (pinned post). Beware that, in the event of a technical failure during the lecture, continuing to accompany the lecture live via zoom might not be possible.

Recording of the lectures will be made available on SwitchTube. We will reuse some of last year's recordings and we may record a few new lectures in case of different lecture contents.
